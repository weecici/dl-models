# Deep Learning Models

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models using PyTorch. The models included are popular and revolutionary architectures such as the **Transformer** from "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al, etc.

## Models Included

- [x] Transformer. [[1]](#1)
- [ ] BERT. [[2]](#2)
- [ ] GPT-1. [[3]](#3)

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- [astral-uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Installation/Setup

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone and navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/weecici/dl-models
